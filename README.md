# QuizGame

## Description
This project creates a quiz game with a series of questions surrounding Javascript. Each question must be answered before moving on to the next round and a green highlighted background will appear on the correct answer. A red background will appear if answered incorrectly. After progressing through the quiz a score screen will tell you how many questions you have answered correctly. 

## Sources
We were provided no starter code for this project, but I did find inspiration for the project on Youtube and Stackoverflow
